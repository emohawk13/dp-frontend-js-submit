Here is an example of the program's output:
arrayOne = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            const instance = newObject([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
            instance.method() => 1
            instance.method() => 5
            instance.method() => 2
            instance.method() => 4
            instance.method() => 3
            instance.method() => undefined (or) throw an error (or) do nothing
