Assignment - Loops Challenges

Use loops and previous coding foundation concepts to solve the following challenges in JavaScript. Note that no outisde libraries may be used to complete these challenges:

Write a program that counts to 10 by 2's

Write a program that extracts values form an array at specific indices and returns the values in a new array.
Here is an example of potential output: removeByIndex[‘a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'f', 'e', 'f'], [1, 5]) => ['b', 'f']]

Write a program that converts a number into an array of numbers. Ensure each element in the array is a number data type and NOT a string data type.
Here is an example of potential output: numToArray(12345) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Write a program to create a new matrix of arrays from two arrays of numbers and strings.
Here is an example of potential output:
arrayOne = [1, 2, 3]
arrayTwo =  ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
 
// OUTPUT: [
    [1, 'a'], ['a', 1], [1, 'b'],
    ['b', 1], [1, 'c'], ['c', 1],
    [1, 'd'], ['d', 1], [2, 'a'],
    ['a', 2], [2, 'b'], ['b', 2],
    [2, 'c'], ['c', 2], [2, 'd'],
    ['d', 2], [3, 'a'], ['a', 3],
    [3, 'b'], ['b', 3], [3, 'c'],
    ['c', 3], [3, 'd'], ['d', 3]
