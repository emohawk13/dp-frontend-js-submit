Assignment - Conditional Challenges

Solve the following code challenges using conditional statements:

Create two objects, each with different key and value pairs from the other object. Put the two objects' keys and values into a third object.
Here is an example of the output:
// first object output
{ id: 1, name: “ryan”}
 
// second object output
{ address: “123 fake st”,
Phone: “555-555-5555”}
 
// third object output
{ id: 1, name: “ryan”, address: “123 fake st”, phone: “555-555-5555”}

Given two (2) numbers, check which is the largest. Within your code block use an if statement and ternary syntax.
Here is an example of the output: largestNum(9,12) => 12

Create a program that will title case a string (capitalize the first letter of each word).
Here is an example of the output: "I am a sentence" => "I Am A Sentence"

Write a program that takes a string and returns the letters in alphabetical order.
Here is an example of the output: "Hi there" => "eeehhhirt"
BONUS: Make the output represent the input characters (each character returns capitalized).
