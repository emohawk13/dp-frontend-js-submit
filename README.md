['a'. 'b', 'cc'] => 'cc'

Write a program that swaps the first and last characters of a string.
'ryan' => 'nyar'

Write a program that finds the sum of a list of numbers.
[1, 2, 3] => 6

Combine two arrays by alternatingly taking elements from each at every iteration.
EX: [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

Create a title case program

EX: "This string has several different values" => "different"

Write a program that takes a string and returns the letters in alphabetical order
EX: "Hi there" => "eehhirt"

Write a program that returns extracted values from an array using specified indices and puts them into a new array.
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [1, 3] => ['b', 'd']
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] is the original code.
[1, 3] is the specified indices fo the array (index 1 and index 3)
[b, d] is the new array returned from the specified indices.


Complete the following steps:
Create an object name 'user'. Give the object 2 (two) properties named userName and activeStatus
the userName property should take any string value.
the starter (or default) for the activeStatus property should be set to 'away'.

Write an arrow function
that changes the activeStatus to 'active'
returns an interpolated string that contains the userName and activeStatus values.
login(user) => 'ryan is active'

Note: Use string interpolation. Avoid hardcoding this.


Write a function that takes a base value and an exponent and will return the product (power).
pow(4,2) => 16

Note: No outside of pre-built functions and the '**' exponent operator is not allowed.
