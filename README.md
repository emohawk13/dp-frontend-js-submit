1st Challenge
Previously, in the JS Data Structures Challenges we completed a program that alternately removed removes from the bacfk and front of an array each time the program ran. Use the same concept with classes while completing the following:


Create a class that manages an array of items
Create a function that will:
splice the managed arrays of items
return each item from alternating sides of the array until the array is empty
Consult the following example of a successful alternating splice function on the created class as you create your own:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
class.pop() => 1
class.pop() => 5
class.pop() => 2
class.pop() => 4
class.pop() => 3
class.pop() => ''
